### CRAVEDU ICATS ONLINE VIDEO LEARNING PLATFORM

## Description

Education has always been a necessary demand for every age group, from young to old, kindergarten to secondary school, diploma to professor level, even adults who don't have any education acknowledgement. But, nowadays people have easy access to knowledge as simple as opening your smart phone and access to the internet, you can start learning. While, the current system, Icats elearn has the limitation where only allow lecturers upload slides and display the date of what topic they wanted to teach on that specific date.

Courseware is an online video education platform that is to be used to complement face to face teaching that Icats elearn cannot achieve, because Icats elearn is not a complete courseware system that allows video teaching to be uploaded to the website. Courseware system that allows students and instructors to conduct lessons entirely online. Which means, students and instructors no need to have an exact physical classroom for them to start a meeting or lesson, instead the instructor records plenty of tutorial courses and uploads to the server. While, students can search for the courses and watch the tutorial on their physical device as many times as they want to and at any time, any place effortlessly. In addition, instructors can give student assessment on each of the particular subjects and students can submit their work online as well.

In this tough circumstance of the pandemic Covid-19, students and lecturers tend to use more electronic devices to conduct the education, but Icats Elearn seems to be left behind due to the limitation of its nature where only allow lecturers to merely share notes online and let the students submits their assignments. This is why Cravedu comes to place, Cravedu is a courseware system that supports asynchronous learning that allows students to sign up and take up courses anywhere and anytime.

Online learning or courseware is a new trend for education, online education supports overseas teaching which the local college couldn't do, instructors or lecturers in Kuching can reach out to the students currently in China virtually, students do not require to travel so far, but they can get what they want just within a few clicks on their device that has cellular data(4G, 5G). Moreover, instructors can upload more courses to the database as they want to, so students can have more opportunity to learn new stuff by joining the courses that are available on the website.
